# Relationship Between COVID-19 and Political Affiliation of States
### Cassidy Gorsky & Vivian Xia

#### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to explore the correlations 
between the spread of the coronavirus, population, and political affiliation among states in the US. The relationships 
are analyzed by modeling the data into a logistsic model to find the maximum number of cases that will arise long term,
the rate of spreadh, the time of maximum spread.

Using the variables and data sourced on political affiliation, a heatmap is created to visualize the 
relationships and their correlation coefficients between the variables. Hypothesis tests are then conducted
to see if the political affiliation of states is statistically significantly different between different variables.

#### Data
Two sets of data were downloaded from [USA Facts](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/).
One set was pertaining to COVID cases in each state and the other set of data was on the population in each state. 
The data on political affiliations of each state in 2016 was sourced from 
[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2016/11/08/500927768/2016-presidential-election-results-for-each-state).
