# MA346 Project 1: Relationship Between COVID-19 and Political Affiliation of States
#### Cassidy Gorsky & Vivian Xia

The purpose of this project is to explore the correlations 
between the spread of the coronavirus, population, and political affiliation among states in the US. The relationships 
are analyzed by modeling the data into a logistsic model to find the maximum number of cases that will arise long term,
the rate of spreadh, the time of maximum spread denoted by $β_0$, $β_1$, $β_2$ respectfully.

Using the variables and data sourced on political affiliation, a heatmap is created to visualize the 
relationships and their correlation coefficients between the variables. Hypothesis tests are then conducted
to see if the political affiliation of states is statistically significantly different between different variables.
